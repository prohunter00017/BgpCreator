# Cloudflare Pages Redirects File
# This file helps with SEO when old pages or domains are removed

# Example redirects for common old pages
# Uncomment and modify as needed for your expired domains:

# /old-page-1 / 301
# /old-page-2 / 301
# /old-category/* /games/ 301
# /blog/* / 301
# /forum/* / 301

# Redirect common misspellings or variations
# /game/* /games/:splat 301
# /play/* /games/:splat 301

# Note: Cloudflare Pages will still serve 404.html for truly missing pages
# The 404.html has automatic redirect built-in to preserve SEO
