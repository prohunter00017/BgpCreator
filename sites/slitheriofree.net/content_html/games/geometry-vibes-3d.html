<h3>1. Not Paying Attention to the Beat</h3>

<h3>2. Rushing Through Levels</h3>
<p>It's easy to get excited and rush through the levels, but taking your time can actually help you do better.

<h3>4. Forgetting to Use Both Waves in Two-Player Mode</h3>
<p>If you're playing with a friend, remember to switch between controlling both waves. Some players stick to one wave and forget about the other, which can make the game much harder. Try to keep both waves safe by switching control when needed. It's like a team effort!</p>

<h3>5. Not Practicing Difficult Levels</h3>
<p>Some levels in Geometry Vibes 3D can be really tough. Instead of getting frustrated and moving on, try practicing these levels. The more you play, the better you'll get at recognizing patterns and reacting quickly. Think of it as training for a big game!</p>
