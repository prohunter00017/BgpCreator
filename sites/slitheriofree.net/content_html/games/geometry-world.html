<h2>Common Mistakes (and Fixes)</h2>
<p>Hey there, young explorers! Geometry World is a fun and exciting place, but sometimes things can get a bit tricky. Let's talk about some common mistakes players make and how you can fix them to become a geometry-world champion!</p>

<h3>1. Rushing Through Levels</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is rushing through the levels. It's easy to get excited and want to move quickly, but this can lead to mistakes. Take your time and carefully watch the obstacles. Remember, the cube moves to the beat of the music, so try to dance along with it. This will help you stay in sync and avoid those pesky spikes and saw blades.</p>

<h3>2. Forgetting to Practice</h3>
<p>Don't skip the practice mode! It's like a warm-up before a big game. Use this time to get familiar with the level. Try to memorize where the obstacles are and plan your moves. This will make the main round much easier and more fun.</p>

<h3>3. Not Using the Right Controls</h3>
<p>Make sure you're using the correct controls. You can use the left-click, spacebar, or up arrow to move your cube. Sometimes players mix up the controls, which can lead to confusion. Pick one control method you're comfortable with and stick to it. This will help you react faster and more accurately.</p>

<h3>4. Getting Dizzy with Portals</h3>
<p>Portals can be a bit tricky. They transport your cube to different parts of the level, and it's easy to get dizzy trying to keep track. Take a deep breath and focus on one portal at a time. Watch where it leads and plan your next move. If you feel overwhelmed, take a short break and come back to it.</p>

<h3>5. Giving Up Too Soon</h3>
<p>Lastly, don't give up if you fail a level. It's all part of the adventure! Learn from your mistakes and try again. Each attempt will make you better and more confident. Remember, every great explorer faces challenges, but that's what makes the journey exciting.</p>
