<h3>Two Tricky Spots to Watch Out For</h3>
<p>There are two tricky spots in Blast Processing that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After the twin wave section, if you bypass the deactivation dual portal, the second cube part will start upside-down. But don't worry! You can still finish the level by quickly jumping after entering the cube portal and leaping over the blocks.</li>
  <li>Right after the first ball segment, when you re-enter the wave form, tapping or clicking right after entering the wave portal will skip the gravity portal. This lets you use anti-gravity to sail through the wave section, dual wave, and part of the cube section.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find Those Secret Coins!</h3>
<p>There are three hidden coins in Blast Processing that you can collect to boost your progress. Here's where to find them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first coin is at 52%, and you get it while in wave form. Enter the third enormous diamond after passing through the dual portal.</li>
  <li>The second coin is at 69%, and you can grab it while in UFO mode. Navigate through the "mouth" of the third major barrier towards the ground, just after passing under the second large face obstacle.</li>
  <li>The third coin is at 86%, and you collect it while in ship form. Look for the cube with artificial spikes and slide beneath the obstruction to get the coin.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fun Trivia</h3>
<p>Did you know that Blast Processing introduces artificial slopes as part of collecting the first hidden coin? These slopes aren't fully shown until the Theory of Everything 2 level. Also, the level isn't named after its Newgrounds song, which is titled "-BlastProcess-," but in other places, the song is called "Blast Processing."</p>
