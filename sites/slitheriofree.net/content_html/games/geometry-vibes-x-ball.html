<h3>Mastering the Zigzag Ball</h3>
<p>First things first, get comfortable with controlling the zigzag ball.

<h3>Level-Specific Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic Mode:</strong> Each level has its own set of challenges. Take your time to understand the pattern of obstacles. For instance, in Level 5, there's a series of fast-moving spikes. Practice slowing down just before you reach them to get a better timing on your jumps.</li>
