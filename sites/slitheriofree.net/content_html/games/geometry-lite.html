<h3>Mistake 1: Jumping at the Wrong Time</h3>

Remember, it’s not a race—take your time and enjoy the ride!</p>
<h3>Mistake 4: Ignoring the Music</h3>
<p>The music in Geometry Lite isn’t just background noise; it’s your guide! Each beat matches the movements of your cube. If you ignore the music, you’re setting yourself up for failure.
