<h3>1. Rushing Through the Dark Ship Section</h3>
<p>The first 10% of the level is a dark ship section with tight corridors and spikes. Many players rush through and end up hitting spikes or missing jumps. Take your time, watch the flashing lights, and use gravity portals to your advantage. Practice this section until you can navigate it smoothly.</p>
<h3>2. Forgetting Patterns in the Wave Section</h3>
<p>In the wave section (11-20%), quick reflexes and memorizing patterns are key. If you find yourself hitting obstacles, slow down and focus on the pattern. Try to remember the sequence of gaps and obstacles. Replay this section multiple times until you can glide through without any issues.</p>
<h3>3. Misjudging Jumps in the UFO Section</h3>
<p>The UFO section (21-30%) requires precise jumps and gravity shifts. A common mistake is misjudging the timing of jumps. Pay close attention to the background and the rhythm of the music. Practice each jump until you can time them perfectly. It might take a few tries, but persistence pays off!</p>
<h3>4. Getting Lost in the Ball Segment</h3>
<p>The ball segment (31-40%) is a maze of platforms and spikes. If you find yourself getting lost, take a step back and observe the path. Look for patterns in the platform movements and spikes. Try to react quickly to changing directions. Replay this section to build muscle memory.</p>
<h3>5. Struggling with the Swing Copter</h3>
<p>The swing copter part (41-50%) is all about control through tight spaces with moving platforms. If you're having trouble, focus on precision timing and adjusting to shifting gravity. Practice controlling your swing copter in a less challenging level first to get a feel for it.</p>
<h3>6. Overlooking the Boss Fight</h3>
<p>The boss fight (51-70%) against Yatagarasu can be overwhelming with projectiles and counterattacks. Don’t get discouraged! Watch the patterns of the projectiles and learn when to dodge. Take your time to understand the boss’s movements. Practice makes perfect!</p>
<h3>7. Failing the Memory-Based Section</h3>
<p>The memory-based section (71-80%) tests your recall of obstacle patterns. If you’re struggling, try to break it down into smaller segments. Memorize the pattern of each segment before moving on to the next. Replay this section until you can recall the patterns effortlessly.</p>
<h3>8. Navigating the Mini-Ship Segment</h3>
<p>In the mini-ship segment (81-90%), the reduced size makes navigation tricky. If you’re hitting obstacles, slow down and focus on your movements. Practice this section to build your reflexes and improve your navigation skills.</p>
<h3>9. Speeding Through the Final Ship Sequence</h3>
<p>The final ship sequence (91-100%) is fast-paced and full of obstacles. Many players speed through and miss jumps. Stay calm, focus on the rhythm, and time your jumps carefully. Practice this section until you can handle the speed and obstacles with ease.</p>
